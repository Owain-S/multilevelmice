# Outline door Thomas

-	Why are standard (ad hoc) methods not well suited?

-	What is heterogeniety? (i.e. variability within studies vs. variability between studies). Random effects for intercept term, predictor effects, and/or variance residual error

- Systematic vs sporadic missingness

-	MICE approach: one-stage imputation versus two-stage imputation methods

-	Imputation of study level versus patient-level covariates

-	Handling MNAR

- Case study: metamisc::impact()

# Think about adding

- JOMO in mice
