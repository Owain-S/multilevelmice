Simulation scenario (iii) provides codes and results for Appendix Table B3 and Simulation scenario (iii) provides codes and results for Appendix Table B4

There are tow folders in each of the above folder: 1. Data Simulation and ii) Data analysis
Data simulation has two subfolder: codes and Data
codes: contains codes to generate 1000 datasets
Data: contains 1000 datasets 

Data analysis folder contains subfolders (accroding to different methods) with codes and results.
For each of the method: codes analyze each of the 1000 datasets and results are obtained as given in the results folders.

Note that: all the codes assumes data and codes are in the same folder in the HPC machine.

All the results from all the methods are combined and presented in the folder name: combined results from all methods
