  abstract = {Instrumental variables was first used in the 1920s to estimate supply and demand elasticities and later to correct for measurement error in single equation models. Recently, instrumental variables have been widely used to reduce bias from omitted variables in estimates of causal relationships. Intuitively, instrumental variables methods use only a portion of the variability in key variables to estimate the relationships of interest; if the instruments are valid, that portion is unrelated to the omitted variables. We discuss the mechanics of instrumental variables and the qualities that make for a good instrument, devoting particular attention to instruments derived from "natural experiments."},

  abstract = {A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples.},

  abstract = {The problem of missing not at random (MNAR) data is a highly complex problem to the difficulty of joint modeling the outcome values and missing pattern while taking the variability of the missing data into consideration. In recent years, two methods by Galimard et. al (2016) and Ogundimu \& Collins (2017) each developed their own multiple imputation (MI) methods for handling MNAR data. However, they have yet to be tested for their effectiveness in research sufficiently. This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of Galimard et. al and Ogundimu \& Collins’ MIs alongside complete case (CC) analysis and Rubin’s MI when applied to two real-life datasets of different size (n1 = 4451, n2 = 1607) with induced missing data of MCAR, MAR, and MNAR mechanisms of 15\%, 30\%, and 50\% missing data percentage. In addition, the methods will also be applied to simulated datasets with imputation and response models more complicated than in Galimard et. al and Ogundimu \& Collins’ studies to see how widely they can be applied in datasets with different missing mechanisms and data percentage. It was found in the application results that Galimard et. al’s MI delivered the same results as CC in all missing mechanism and percentage combinations. For both datasets, Ogundimu \& Collins’ MI performed better than the other 3 methods for 50\% MNAR, though overall, both Galimard et. al and Ogundimu \& Collins’ MIs performed better on MCAR and MAR data than MNAR. In simulation, Galimard et. al’s MI also delivered results consistently identical to CC for all missing percentage and mechanism combinations. Ogundimu \& Collins’ MI consistently delivered superior results than the other 3 methods for 15\% and 30\% MNAR. However, Ogundimu \& Collins’ MI should be used with caution because it did not converge for 50\% missing and only converged for approximately 100 – 400 datasets out of 1000 for 15\% and 30\%. It will be interesting if future studies can apply Galimard et. al and Ogundimu \& Collins’ MI methods other real-life datasets and easily-converge simulated datasets to see how well they can work when applied broadly in research and industry.},

  abstract = {Sample selection arises when the outcome of interest is partially observed in a study. Although sophisticated statistical methods in the parametric and non-parametric framework have been proposed to solve this problem, it is yet unclear how to deal with selectively missing covariate data using simple multiple imputation techniques, especially in the absence of exclusion restrictions and deviation from normality. Motivated by the 2003–2004 NHANES data, where previous authors have studied the effect of socio-economic status on blood pressure with missing data on income variable, we proposed the use of a robust imputation technique based on the selection-t sample selection model. The imputation method, which is developed within the frequentist framework, is compared with competing alternatives in a simulation study. The results indicate that the robust alternative is not susceptible to the absence of exclusion restrictions – a property inherited from the parent selection-t model – and performs better than models based on the normal assumption even when the data is generated from the normal distribution. Applications to missing outcome and covariate data further corroborate the robustness properties of the proposed method. We implemented the proposed approach within the MICE environment in R Statistical Software.},

It shows that exploratory work to check for collinearity problems is strongly recommended before deciding on which estimator to apply. In the absence of collinearity problems, the full–information maximum likelihood estimator is preferable to the limited–information two–step method of Heckman, although the latter also gives reasonable results. If, however, collinearity problems prevail, subsample OLS (or the Two–Part Model) is the most robust amongst the simple–to–calculate estimators.},

  abstract = {In multilevel settings such as individual participant data meta-analysis, a variable is ‘systematically missing’ if it is wholly missing in some clusters and ‘sporadically missing’ if it is partly missing in some clusters. Previously proposed methods to impute incomplete multilevel data handle either systematically or sporadically missing data, but frequently both patterns are observed. We describe a new multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) algorithm for multilevel data with arbitrary patterns of systematically and sporadically missing variables. The algorithm is described for multilevel normal data but can easily be extended for other variable types. We first propose two methods for imputing a single incomplete variable: an extension of an existing method and a new two-stage method which conveniently allows for heteroscedastic data. We then discuss the difficulties of imputing missing values in several variables in multilevel data using MICE, and show that even the simplest joint multilevel model implies conditional models which involve cluster means and heteroscedasticity. However, a simulation study finds that the proposed methods can be successfully combined in a multilevel MICE procedure, even when cluster means are not included in the imputation models.},

  abstract = {It has been established that H+ secretion can be maintained in frog stomach in the absence of exogenous CO2 by using a nutrient bathing fluid containing 25 mM H2PO4 (pH approximately equal to 4.5) or by lowering the pH of a nonbuffered nutrient solution to about 3.0-3.6. Exogenous CO2 in the presence of these nutrient solutions uniformly caused a marked decrease in H+ secretion, PD, adn short-circuit current (Isc) and an increase in transmucosal resistance (R). Elevation of nutrient [k+] to 83 mM reduced R significantly but transiently without change in H+ when nutrient pH less than 5.0, whereas R returned to base line and H+ increased when nutrient pH greater than 5.0. Acidification of the nutrient medium in the presence of exogenous CO2 results in inhibition of the secretory pump, probably by decreasing intracellular pH, and also interferes with conductance at the nutrient membrane. Removal of exogenous CO2 from standard bicarbonate nutrient solution reduced by 50\% the H+, PD, and Isc without change in R; K+-free nutrient solutions reverse these changes in Isc and PD but not in H+. The dropping PD and rising R induced by K+-free nutrient solutions in 5\% CO2 - 95\% O2 are returned toward normal by 100\% O2. Our findings support an important role for exogenous CO2 in maintaining normal acid-base balance in frog mucosa by acting as an acidifying agent.},

  abstract = {Background Meta-analyses based on individual patient data (IPD) are regarded as the gold standard for systematic reviews. However, the methods used for analysing and presenting results from IPD meta-analyses have received little discussion.              Methods We review 44 IPD meta-analyses published during the years 1999–2001. We summarize whether they obtained all the data they sought, what types of approaches were used in the analysis, including assumptions of common or random effects, and how they examined the effects of covariates.              Results Twenty-four out of 44 analyses focused on time-to-event outcomes, and most analyses (28) estimated treatment effects within each trial and then combined the results assuming a common treatment effect across trials. Three analyses failed to stratify by trial, analysing the data is if they came from a single mega-trial. Only nine analyses used random effects methods. Covariate-treatment interactions were generally investigated by subgrouping patients. Seven of the meta-analyses included data from less than 80\% of the randomized patients sought, but did not address the resulting potential biases.              Conclusions Although IPD meta-analyses have many advantages in assessing the effects of health care, there are several aspects that could be further developed to make fuller use of the potential of these time-consuming projects. In particular, IPD could be used to more fully investigate the influence of covariates on heterogeneity of treatment effects, both within and between trials. The impact of heterogeneity, or use of random effects, are seldom discussed. There is thus considerable scope for enhancing the methods of analysis and presentation of IPD meta-analysis.},

The amount of heterogeneity in a set of effect sizes has implications regarding the interpretation of the meta-analytic findings and often serves as an indicator for the presence of potential moderator variables.
