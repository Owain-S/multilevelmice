\Abstract{
This tutorial illustrates the imputation of incomplete multilevel data
with the \proglang{R} packackage \pkg{mice}. Our scope is only simple
multilevel models, to show how imputation can yield less biased
estimates from incomplete clustered data. More complex models can be
accomodated, but are outside the scope of this paper.

\hypertarget{multilevel-data}{%
\subsection{Multilevel data}\label{multilevel-data}}

Many datasets include individuals that are clustered together, for
example in geographic regions, or even different studies. In the
simplest case, individuals (e.g., students) are nested within a single
cluster (e.g., school classes). More complex clustered structures may
occur when there are multiple hierarchical levels (e.g., students in
different schools or patients within hospitals within regions across
countries), or when the clustering is non-nested (e.g., electronic
health record data from diverse settings and populations within large
databases). With clustered data we generally assume that individuals
from the same cluster tend to be more similar than individuals from
other clusters. In statistical terms, this implies that observations
from the same cluster are not independent and may in fact be correlated.
If this correlation is left unaddressed, estimates of \emph{p} values,
confidence intervals even model parameters are prone to bias
\citep{loca01}. Statistical methods for clustered data typically adopt
hierarchical models that explicitly describe the grouping of
observations. These models are also known as `multilevel models',
`hierarchical models', `mixed effect models', `random effect models',
and in the context of time-to-event data as `frailty models'. Table
\ref{tab:clus} provides an overview of some key concepts in multilevel
modeling.

\hypertarget{missingness-in-multilevel-data}{%
\subsection{Missingness in multilevel
data}\label{missingness-in-multilevel-data}}

As with any other dataset, clustered datasets may be impacted by
missingness in much the same way. Several strategies can be used to
handle missing data, including complete case analysis and imputation. We
focus on the latter approach and discuss statistical methods for
replacing the missing data with one or more plausible values. Imputation
separates the missing data problem from the analysis and the completed
data can be analyzed as if it were completely observed. It is generally
recommended to impute the missing values more than once to preserve
uncertainty due to missingness and to allow for valid inferences (c.f.
Rubin 1976).

With incomplete clustered datasets we can distinguish between two types
of missing data: sporadic missingness and systematic missingness
\citep{resc13}. Sporadic missingness arises when variables are missing
for some but not all of the units in a cluster \citep{buur18, jola18}.
For example, it is possible that test results are missing for several
students in one or more classes. When all observations are missing
within one or more clusters, data are said to be systematically missing.
Sporadic missingness is visualized in Figure XYZ.

\begin{CodeChunk}

}

\caption[Sporadic missingness in multilevel data]{Sporadic missingness in multilevel data}\label{fig:patterns}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Imputation of missing data requires consideration of the mechanism
behind the missingness. Rubin proposed to distinguish between data that
are missing completely at random (MCAR), data that are missing at random
(MAR) and data that are missing not at random (MNAR; see Table
\ref{tab:miss}). For each of these three missingness generating
mechanisms, different imputation strategies are warranted
(\citet{yuce08} and \citet{hox15}). We here consider the general case
that data are MAR, and expand on certain MNAR situations.

\hypertarget{aim-of-this-paper}{%
\subsection{Aim of this paper}\label{aim-of-this-paper}}

This papers serves as a tutorial for imputing incomplete multilevel data
with \pkg{mice} in \proglang{R}. \pkg{mice} has become the de-facto
standard for imputation by chained equations, which iteratively solves
the missingness on a variable-by-variable basis. \pkg{mice} is known to
yield valid inferences under many different missing data circumstances
\citep{buur18}.

We provide practical guidelines and code snippets for different missing
data situations, including non-ignorable mechanisms. For reasons of
brevity, we focus on multilevel imputation by chained equations with
\pkg{mice} exclusively; other imputation methods and packages \citep[see
e.g.][ and \citet{grun18}]{audi18} are outside the scope of this
tutorial. Assumed knowledge includes basic familiarity with the
\pkg{lme4} notation for multilevel models (see Table \ref{tab:mod}).

We illustrate imputation of incomplete multilevel data using three case
studies:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{popmis} from the \pkg{mice} package \citep[simulated data on
  perceived popularity, \(n = 2,000\) pupils across \(N = 100\) schools
  with data that are MAR,][]{mice};
\item
  \texttt{impact} from the \pkg{metamisc} package \citep[empirical data
  on traumatic brain injuries, \(n = 11,022\) patients across \(N = 15\)
  studies with data that are MAR,][]{metamisc};
\item
  \texttt{obesity} from the \pkg{micemd} package {[}simulated data on
  obesity, \(n = 2,111\) patients across \(N = 5\) regions with data
  that are MNAR{]}.
\end{itemize}

For each of these datasets, we discuss the nature of the missingness,
choose one or more imputation models and evaluate the imputed data, but
we will also highlight one specific aspect of the imputation workflow.

This tutorial is dedicated to readers who are unfamiliar with multiple
imputation. More experienced readers can skip the introduction (case
study 1) and directly head to practical applications of multilevel
imputation under MAR conditions (case study 2) or under MNAR conditions
(case study 3).

\hypertarget{case-study-i-popularity-data}{%
\section{Case study I: popularity
data}\label{case-study-i-popularity-data}}

In this section we will go over the different steps involved with
imputing incomplete multilevel data with the R package mice. We consider
the simulated \texttt{popmis} dataset, which included pupils
(\(n = 2000\)) clustered within schools (\(N = 100\)). The following
variables are of primary interest:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{school}, school identification number (clustering variable);
\item
  \texttt{popular}, pupil popularity (self-rating between 0 and 10;
  unit-level);
\item
  \texttt{sex}, pupil sex (0=boy, 1=girl; unit-level);
\item
  \texttt{texp}, teacher experience (in years; cluster-level).
\end{itemize}

The research objective of the \texttt{popmis} dataset is to predict the
pupils' popularity based on their gender and the experience of the
teacher. The analysis model corresponding to this dataset is multilevel
regression with random intercepts, random slopes and a cross-level
interaction. The outcome variable is \texttt{popular}, which is
predicted from the unit-level variable \texttt{sex} and the
cluster-level variable \texttt{texp}:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> mod <- popular ~ 1 + sex + (1 | school)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The estimated effects in the complete data are presented in Table XYZ.
We consider the associations in the full data set to be the true
associations.

Load the data into the environment and select the relevant variables:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> popmis <- popmis[, c("school", "popular", "sex")] 
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

First we plot the pattern of missing data within categories of the
relevant variables. Plot the missing data pattern:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_pattern(popmis)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop_pat-1} 

}

\caption[Missing data pattern in the popularity data]{Missing data pattern in the popularity data}\label{fig:pop_pat}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

The missingness is univariate and sporadic, which is illustrated in the
missing data pattern in Figure \ref{fig:pop_pat}.

The ICC in the incomplete data is
\texttt{round(icc(popular\ \textasciitilde{}\ as.factor(school),\ data\ =\ na.omit(popmis)),\ 2)}.
This tells us that the multilevel structure of the data should probably
be taken into account. If we don't, we'll may end up with incorrect
imputations, biasing the effect of the clusters towards zero.

To develop the best imputation model for the incomplete variable
\texttt{popular}, we need to know whether the observed values of
\texttt{popular} are related to observed values of other variables. Plot
the pair-wise complete correlations in the incomplete data:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_corr(popmis)
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop-corr-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

This shows us that \texttt{sex} may be a useful imputation model
predictor. Moreover, the missingness in \texttt{popular} may depend on
the observed values of other variables.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> # ggmice(popmis, aes(sex)) +
R> #   geom_histogram(fill = "white") +
R> #   facet_grid(. ~ is.na(popular), scales = "free", labeller = label_both)
R> 
R> ggplot(popmis, aes(y = popular, group = sex)) +
+   geom_boxplot() + 
+   theme_classic()
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop-hist-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{imputation-ignoring-the-cluster-variable-not-recommended}{%
\subsubsection{Imputation ignoring the cluster variable (not
recommended)}\label{imputation-ignoring-the-cluster-variable-not-recommended}}

The first imputation model that we'll use is likely to be invalid. We do
\emph{not} use the cluster identifier \texttt{school} as imputation
model predictor. With this model, we ignore the multilevel structure of
the data, despite the high ICC. This assumes exchangeability between
units. We include it purely to illustrate the effects of ignoring the
clustering in our imputation effort.

Create a methods vector and predictor matrix for \texttt{popular}, and
make sure \texttt{school} is not included as predictor:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> meth <- make.method(popmis) # methods vector
R> pred <- quickpred(popmis)   # predictor matrix
R> plot_pred(pred)
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop-ignored-pred-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

Impute the data, ignoring the cluster structure:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> imp <- mice(popmis, pred = pred, print = FALSE)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Evaluate the convergence of the algorithm:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_trace(imp)
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop-ignored-conv-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

Analyze the imputations:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> fit <- with(imp, 
+             lmer(popular ~ 1 + sex  + (1 | school))) 
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Print the estimates:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> testEstimates(as.mitml.result(fit), extra.pars = TRUE)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{imputation-with-the-cluster-variable-as-predictor-not-recommended}{%
\subsubsection{Imputation with the cluster variable as predictor (not
recommended)}\label{imputation-with-the-cluster-variable-as-predictor-not-recommended}}

We'll now use \texttt{school} as a predictor to impute all other
variables. This is still not recommended practice, since it only works
under certain circumstances and results may be biased
\citep{drec15, ende16}. But at least, it includes some multilevel
aspect. This method is also called `fixed cluster imputation', and uses
N-1 indicator variables representing allocation of N clusters as a fixed
factor in the model \citep{reit06, ende16}. Colloquially, this is
`multilevel imputation for dummies'.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> # adjust the predictor matrix
R> pred["popular", "school"] <- 1 
R> plot_pred(pred)
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop_predictor-1} \end{center}

\begin{CodeInput}

\section{Case study II: IMPACT data (syst missingness, pred
matrix)}\label{case-study-ii-impact-data-syst-missingness-pred-matrix}}

We illustrate how to impute incomplete multilevel data by means of a
case study: \texttt{impact} from the \pkg{metamisc} package
\citep[empirical data on traumatic brain injuries, \(n = 11,022\) units
across \(N = 15\) clusters,][]{metamisc}. The \texttt{impact} data set
contains traumatic brain injury data on \(n = 11022\) patients clustered
in \(N = 15\) studies with the following 11 variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{name} Name of the study,
\item
  \texttt{type} Type of study (RCT: randomized controlled trial, OBS:
  observational cohort),
\item
  \texttt{age} Age of the patient,
\item
  \texttt{motor\_score} Glasgow Coma Scale motor score,
\item
  \texttt{pupil} Pupillary reactivity,
\item
  \texttt{ct} Marshall Computerized Tomography classification,
\item
  \texttt{hypox} Hypoxia (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{hypots} Hypotension (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{tsah} Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{edh} Epidural hematoma (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{mort} 6-month mortality (0=alive, 1=dead).
\end{itemize}

The analysis model for this dataset is a prediction model with
\texttt{mort} as the outcome. In this tutorial we'll estimate the
adjusted prognostic effect of \texttt{ct} on mortality outcomes. The
estimand is the adjusted odds ratio for \texttt{ct}, after including
\texttt{type}, \texttt{age} \texttt{motor\_score} and \texttt{pupil}
into the analysis model:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> mod <- mort ~ 1 + type + age + motor_score + pupil + ct + (1 | name) 
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Note that variables \texttt{hypots}, \texttt{hypox}, \texttt{tsah} and
\texttt{edh} are not part of the analysis model, and may thus serve as
auxiliary variables for imputation.

The \texttt{impact} data included in the \pkg{metamisc} package is a
complete data set. The original data has already been imputed once
(Steyerberg et al, 2008). For the purpose of this tutorial we have
induced missingness (mimicking the missing data in the original data set
before imputation). The resulting incomplete data can be accessed from
\href{https://zenodo.com}{zenodo link to be created}.

Load the complete and incomplete data into the R workspace:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> data("impact", package = "metamisc")      # complete data
R> dat <- read.table("link/to/the/data.txt") # incomplete data
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The estimated effects in the complete data are presented in Table XYZ.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> # fit <- glmer(mod, family = "binomial", data = impact) # fit the model
R> # tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)       # print estimates
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{missingness}{%
\subsection{Missingness}\label{missingness}}

To explore the missingness, it is wise to look at the missing data
pattern. The ten most frequent missingness patterns are shown:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_pattern(dat, rotate = TRUE, npat = 10L)  # plot missingness pattern
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pattern-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

This shows that we need to impute \texttt{ct} and \texttt{pupil}.

To develop the best imputation model, we need to investigate the
relations between the observed values of the incomplete variables and
the observed values of other variables, and the relation between the
missingness indicators of the incomplete variables and the observed
values of the other variables. To see whether the missingness depends on
the observed values of other variables, we can test this statistically
or use visual inspection (e.g.~a histogram faceted by the missingness
indicator).

We should impute the variables \texttt{ct} and \texttt{pupil} and any
auxiliary variables we might want to use to impute these incomplete
analysis model variables. We can evaluate which variables may be useful
auxiliaries by plotting the pairwise complete correlations:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_corr(dat, rotate = TRUE) # plot correlations 
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/impact_corr-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

This shows us that \texttt{hypox} and \texttt{hypot} would not be useful
auxiliary variables for imputing \texttt{ct}. Depending on the minimum
required correlation, \texttt{tsah} could be useful, while \texttt{edh}
has the strongest correlation with \texttt{ct} out of all the variables
in the data and should definitely be included in the imputation model.
For the imputation of \texttt{pupil}, none of the potential auxiliary
variables has a very strong relation, but \texttt{hypots} could be used.
We conclude that we can exclude \texttt{hypox} from the data, since this
is neither an analysis model variable nor an auxiliary variable for
imputation:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> dat <- select(dat, !hypox)  # remove variable
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{complete-case-analysis}{%

As previously stated, complete case analysis lowers statistical power
and may bias results. The complete case analysis estimates are:

\end{itemize}

An alternative approach to missing data is to use Full Information
Maximum Likelihood (FIML). This method does not require the imputation
of any missing values. Whereas MI consists of imputation, analyses and
pooling steps, FIML analyses the data in a single step. When the
assumptions are met the two approaches should produce equivalent
results. {[}REF{]} As FIML requires specialised software, not all
analyses can be performed with standard software. {[}REF{]}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Survival / TTE, this could be put in the paragraph on congeniality
\end{itemize}

When the outcome is time-to-event, the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the time
to event should be included as a covariate in the imputation model
{[}REF{]}

In hierarchical datasets, clustering is a concern because the
homoscedasticity in the error terms cannot be assumed across clusters
and the relationship among variables may vary at different hierarchical
levels. When multiple imputation is used to deal with missing data, as
the imputation and analysis process is performed separately, it is
necessary that imputation model being congenial with the main analysis
model (Meng, 1994), e.g.~if the main model accounts for the hierarchical
structure also imputation model should do it (Audigier, 2021). Not
including clustering into the imputation process may lead to effect
estimates with smaller standard errors and inflated type I error.

There are different strategies that can be adopted in the imputation
process that account for clustering: inclusion of cluster indicator
variable, performing a separate imputation process for each cluster, or
performing a simultaneous imputation process by using an imputation
method that accounts for clustering.(Stata:
\url{https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/clustering-and-mi-impute/})
TODO: replace ref.

The selection of each strategy depends mainly on the assumptions in the
main analysis and also on the restriction of the analyzed data.

Regarding the restrictions imposed by the data, for instance, the use of
cluster indicator variables is restricted in datasets where there are
not many clusters and many observations per cluster (Graham, 2009). The
last restriction is also required when imputations are performed on each
cluster separately. When this restriction cannot be achieved, one can
use an imputation model that simultaneously imputes all clusters using a
hierarchical model (Allison 2002).

Under this hierarchical imputation model, observations within clusters
are correlated and this correlation is modeled by a random effect so the
hierarchical model can be estimated even when there are few observations
per cluster. However, this strategy is best suited for balanced data
(Grund, 2017) and when random effects model is appropriated, i.e.~the
number of clusters is adequate. (Austin,2018).

Here it is important to evaluate the assumptions imposed by the main
model, for instance by using the cluster indicator strategy may lead to
bias estimates when the model is based on a hierarchical model
(Taaljard,2008). Even when an imputation strategy congenial with the
main model is preferred, it is important to consider whether it is
appropriate for the data as a less complex imputation strategies may
also lead to unbiased estimates in certain scenarios(Bailey 2020). For
instance, in causal effect analysis, separately imputation may lead to
smaller bias when the size of the smaller exposure cluster is large,
compared with an imputation model that includes exposure-confounder
interactions. (Zhang,2023).
