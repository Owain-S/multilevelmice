\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Many datasets include individuals from multiple settings, geographic
regions, or even different studies. In the simplest case, individuals
(e.g., students) are nested within so-called clusters (e.g., school
classes). More complex clustered structures may occur when there are
multiple hierarchical levels (e.g., patients within hospitals within
regions or countries), or when the clustering is non-nested (e.g.,
electronic health record data from diverse settings and populations
within large databases). In general, individuals from the same cluster
tend to be more similar than individuals from other clusters. In
statistical terms, this implies that observations from the same cluster
are correlated. If this correlation is left unaddressed, estimates of
\emph{p} values, confidence intervals even model parameters are prone to
bias \citep{loca01}. {[}TODO: make a link to imputation methods, which
require adequate handling and propagation of variance; we are not
recommending the adoption of multilevel models for data analysis here,
but rather for imputation.{]} Statistical methods for clustered data
typically adopt hierarchical models that explicitly describe the
grouping of observations. These models are also know as `multilevel
models', `hierarchical models', `mixed effect models' and `random effect
models'. Table \ref{tab:clus} provides an overview of some key concepts
in multilevel modeling.

\subsection{Missingness in multilevel
data}\label{missingness-in-multilevel-data}}

Like any other dataset, clustered datasets are prone to missing data.
Several strategies can be used to handle missing data, including
complete case analysis and imputation. We focus on the latter approach
and discuss statistical methods for replacing the missing data with one
or more plausible values. Afterwards, the completed data can be analyzed
as if they were completely observed. In contrast to single imputation
(where missing data are only replaced once), multiple imputation allows
to preserve uncertainty due to missingness and is therefore recommended
(c.f. Rubin 1976).

When clustered datasets are affected by missing values, we can
distinguish between two types of missing data: sporadic missingness and
systematic missingness \citep{resc13}. Sporadic missingness arises when
variables are missing for some but not all of the units in a cluster
\citep{buur18, jola18}. For example, it is possible that test results
are missing for several students in one or more classes. {[}TODO:
Provide an example for one of the case studies below.{]} When all
observations are missing within one or more clusters, data are
systematically missing. {[}TODO: Refer to Figure 1 and put
interpretation in the figure caption.{]}

}

\caption[Missingness in multilevel data]{Missingness in multilevel data}\label{fig:patterns}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Imputation of missing data requires to consider the mechanism behind the
missingness. Rubin proposed to distinguish between data that are missing
completely at random (MCAR), data that are missing at random (MAR) and
data that are missing not at random (MNAR; see Table \ref{tab:miss}).
For each of these three missingness generating mechanisms, different
imputation strategies are warranted \citet{yuce08} and \citet{hox15}. We
here consider the general case that data are MAR, and expand on special
MNAR situations.

\begin{table}[tb]

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\textbf{Concept} & \textbf{Details}   \\
\hline

& across all data entries \\
MAR     & Missing At Random, where the probability to be missing depends on observed \\
& information \\
MNAR    & Missing Not At Random (MNAR), where the probability to be missing \\
& depends on unrecorded information, making the missingness non-ignorable \\
& [@rubi76; @meng94]. \\
& [TODO: add congeniality, but maybe in-text?] \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The \proglang{R} package \pkg{mice} has become the de-facto standard for
imputation by chained equations, which iteratively solves the
missingness on a variable-by-variable basis. \pkg{mice} is known to
yield valid inferences under many different missing data circumstances
\citep{buur18}. However, commonly used imputation methods were not
designed for use in clustered data and usually generate observations
that are independent. For this reason, we discuss how the \proglang{R}
package \pkg{mice} can be used to impute multilevel data.

{[}TODO: clarify why clustering is relevant during imputation, and why
this exposes the need for specialized imputation methods and more
attention during their implementation (``thou shall not simply run
\texttt{mice()} on any incomplete dataset'').{]} {[}TODO: Add that the
more the random effects are of interest, the more you need multilevel
imputation models.{]} {[}TODO: Add an overview of all possible predictor
matrix values in manuscript or \texttt{ggmice} legend.{]}

\hypertarget{aim-of-this-paper}{%
\subsection{Aim of this paper}\label{aim-of-this-paper}}

This papers serves as a tutorial for imputing incomplete multilevel data
with \pkg{mice} in \proglang{R}. We provide practical guidelines and
code snippets for different missing data situations, including
non-ignorable mechanisms. For reasons of brevity, we focus on multilevel
imputation by chained equations with \pkg{mice} exclusively; other
imputation methods and packages (e.g., \pkg{jomo} and \pkg{mdmb}) are
outside the scope of this tutorial. Assumed knowledge includes basic
familiarity with multilevel imputation \citep[see e.g.][ and
\citet{grun18}]{audi18} and the \pkg{lme4} notation for multilevel
models (see Table \ref{tab:mod}).

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We illustrate imputation of incomplete multilevel data using three case
studies:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{popmis} from the \pkg{mice} package \citep[simulated data on
  perceived popularity, \(n = 2,000\) pupils across \(N = 100\) schools
  with data that are MAR,][]{mice};
\item
  \texttt{impact} from the \pkg{metamisc} package \citep[empirical data
  on traumatic brain injuries, \(n = 11,022\) patients across \(N = 15\)
  studies with data that are MAR,][]{metamisc};
\item
  \texttt{hiv} from the \pkg{GJRM} package \citep[simulated data on HIV
  diagnoses, \(n = 6,416\) patients across \(N = 9\) regions with data
  that are MNAR,][]{GJRM}.
\end{itemize}

For each of these datasets, we discuss the nature of the missingness,
choose one or more imputation models and evaluate the imputed data, but
we will also highlight one specific aspect of the imputation workflow.

This tutorial is dedicated to readers who are unfamiliar with multiple
imptuation. More experienced readers can skip the introduction (case
study 1) and directly head to practical applications of multilevel
imputation under MAR conditions (case study IMPACT) or under MNAR
conditions (case study HIV).

\hypertarget{case-study-i-popularity-data}{%
\section{Case study I: popularity
data}\label{case-study-i-popularity-data}}

{[}TODO: explain case study{]}

In this section we'll go over the different steps involved with imputing
incomplete multilevel data with the R package mice. We consider the
simulated \texttt{popmis} dataset, which included pupils (\(n = 2000\))
clustered within schools (\(N = 100\)). The following variables are of
primary interest:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{school}, school identification number (clustering variable);
\item
  \texttt{popular}, pupil popularity (self-rating between 0 and 10;
  unit-level);
\item
  \texttt{sex}, pupil sex (0=boy, 1=girl; unit-level);
\item
  \texttt{texp}, teacher experience (in years; cluster-level).
\end{itemize}

The research objective of the popmis dataset is to predict the pupils'
popularity based on their gender and the experience of the teacher. The
analysis model corresponding to this dataset is multilevel regression
with random intercepts, random slopes and a cross-level interaction. The
outcome variable is \texttt{popular}, which is predicted from the
unit-level variable \texttt{sex} and the cluster-level variable
\texttt{texp}:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> mod <- popular ~ 1 + sex + texp + sex:texp + (1 + sex | school)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Load the data into the environment and select the relevant variables:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> popmis <- popmis[, c("school", "popular", "sex", "texp")] 
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Plot the missing data pattern:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_pattern(popmis)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop_pat-1} 

}

\caption[Missing data pattern in the popularity data]{Missing data pattern in the popularity data}\label{fig:pop_pat}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

The missingness is univariate and sporadic, which is illustrated in the
missing data pattern in Figure \ref{fig:pop_pat}.

To develop the best imputation model for the incomplete variable
\texttt{popular}, we need to know whether the observed values of
\texttt{popular} are related to observed values of other variables. Plot
the pair-wise complete correlations in the incomplete data:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_corr(popmis)
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop-corr-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

This shows us that both \texttt{sex} and \texttt{texp} may be useful
imputation model predictors. Moreover, the missingness in
\texttt{popular} may depend on the observed values of other variables.
We'll highlight one other variable to illustrate, but ideally one would
inspect all relations. The questions we'll ask are: `Does the missing
data of pupil popularity (\texttt{popular}) depend on observed teacher
popularity (\texttt{texp})?'. This can be evaluated statistically, but
visual inspection usually suffices. We'll make a histogram of
\texttt{texp} separately for the pupils with known popularity and
missing popularity.

Plot the histogram for teacher experience conditional on the missingness
indicator of \texttt{popular}:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> ggmice(popmis, aes(texp)) +
+   geom_histogram(fill = "white") +
+   facet_grid(. ~ is.na(popular), scales = "free", labeller = label_both)
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop-hist-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

This shows us that there are no apparent differences in the distribution
of \texttt{texp} depending on the missingness indicator of
\texttt{popular} (t = -0.873, p = 0.383). {[}TODO: think about what is a
meaningful rule of thumb to signal that the user should be worried?{]}

\hypertarget{imputation-ignoring-the-cluster-variable-not-recommended}{%
\subsubsection{Imputation ignoring the cluster variable (not
recommended)}\label{imputation-ignoring-the-cluster-variable-not-recommended}}

The first imputation model that we'll use is likely to be invalid. We do
\emph{not} use the cluster identifier \texttt{school} as imputation
model predictor. With this model, we ignore the multilevel structure of
the data, despite the high ICC. This assumes exchangeability between
units. We include it purely to illustrate the effects of ignoring the
clustering in our imputation effort.

Create a methods vector and predictor matrix for \texttt{popular}, and
make sure \texttt{school} is not included as predictor:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> meth <- make.method(popmis) # methods vector
R> pred <- quickpred(popmis)   # predictor matrix
R> plot_pred(pred)
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pop-ignored-pred-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

Impute the data, ignoring the cluster structure:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> imp <- mice(popmis, pred = pred, print = FALSE)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Analyze the imputations:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> fit <- with(imp, 
+             lmer(popular ~ 1 + sex + texp + sex:texp + (1 + sex | school))) 
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Print the estimates:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> testEstimates(as.mitml.result(fit), extra.pars = TRUE)
\end{CodeInput}

\subsubsection{Imputation with the cluster variable as predictor (not

We'll now use \texttt{school} as a predictor to impute all other
variables. This is still not recommended practice, since it only works
under certain circumstances and results may be biased
\citep{drec15, ende16}. But at least, it includes some multilevel
aspect. This method is also called `fixed cluster imputation', and uses
N-1 indicator variables representing allocation of N clusters as a fixed
factor in the model \citep{reit06, ende16}. Colloquially, this is
`multilevel imputation for dummies'.

{[}TODO: Add that it doesn't work with systematic missingness (only with
sporadic). There's some pros and cons, and it may not even differ much
if the number of clusters is low.{]}

across \(N = 15\) clusters,][]{metamisc}. {[}TODO: add more info about
the complete data.{]} The \texttt{impact} data set contains traumatic
brain injury data on \(n = 11022\) patients clustered in \(N = 15\)
studies with the following 11 variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{name} Name of the study,
\item
  \texttt{type} Type of study (RCT: randomized controlled trial, OBS:
  observational cohort),
\item
  \texttt{age} Age of the patient,
\item
  \texttt{motor\_score} Glasgow Coma Scale motor score,
\item
  \texttt{pupil} Pupillary reactivity,
\item
  \texttt{ct} Marshall Computerized Tomography classification,
\item
  \texttt{hypox} Hypoxia (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{hypots} Hypotension (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{tsah} Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{edh} Epidural hematoma (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{mort} 6-month mortality (0=alive, 1=dead).
\end{itemize}

The analysis model for this dataset is a prediction model with
\texttt{mort} as the outcome. In this tutorial we'll estimate the
adjusted prognostic effect of \texttt{ct} on unfortunate outcomes. The
estimand is the adjusted odds ratio for \texttt{ct}, after including
\texttt{type}, \texttt{age} \texttt{motor\_score} and \texttt{pupil}
into the analysis model:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> mod <- mort ~ 1 + type + age + motor_score + pupil + ct + (1 | name) 
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Note that variables \texttt{hypots}, \texttt{hypox}, \texttt{tsah} and
\texttt{edh} are not part of the analysis model, and may thus serve as
auxiliary variables for imputation.

The \texttt{impact} data included in the \pkg{metamisc} package is a
complete data set. The original data has already been imputed once
(Steyerberg et al, 2008). For the purpose of this tutorial we have
induced missingness (mimicking the missing data in the original data set
before imputation). The resulting incomplete data can be accessed from
\href{https://zenodo.com}{zenodo link to be created}.

Load the complete and incomplete data into the R workspace:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> data("impact", package = "metamisc")      # complete data
R> dat <- read.table("link/to/the/data.txt") # incomplete data
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The estimated effects in the complete data are visualized in Figure
\ref{}.

\begin{CodeChunk}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/forest-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> # fit <- glmer(mod, family = "binomial", data = impact) # fit the model
R> # tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)       # print estimates
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

{[}TODO: show how much variance there is after different methods{]}

{[}TODO: add ICC before/after imputation and interpret: This tells us
that the multilevel structure of the data should probably be taken into
account. If we don't, we'll may end up with incorrect imputations,
biasing the effect of the clusters towards zero.{]}

{[}TODO: add descriptive statistics of the complete and incomplete
data.{]}

\hypertarget{missingness}{%
\subsection{Missingness}\label{missingness}}

To explore the missingness, it is wise to look at the missing data
pattern:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_pattern(dat, rotate = TRUE)  # plot missingness pattern
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/pattern-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

This shows\ldots{} {[}TODO: fill in that we need to impute \texttt{ct}
and \texttt{pupil}.{]}

To develop the best imputation model, we need to investigate the
relations between the observed values of the incomplete variables and
the observed values of other variables, and the relation between the
missingness indicators of the incomplete variables and the observed
values of the other variables. To see whether the missingness depends on
the observed values of other variables, we\ldots{} {[}TODO: fill in that
we can test this statistically or use visual inspection (e.g.~a
histogram faceted by the missingness indicator).{]}

We should impute the variables \texttt{ct} and \texttt{pupil} and any
auxiliary variables we might want to use to impute these incomplete
analysis model variables. We can evaluate which variables may be useful
auxiliaries by plotting the pairwise complete correlations:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> plot_corr(dat, rotate = TRUE) # plot correlations 
\end{CodeInput}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Imputation_of_Incomplete_Multilevel_Data_files/figure-latex/impact_corr-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

This shows us that \texttt{hypox} and \texttt{hypot} would not be useful
auxiliary variables for imputing \texttt{ct}. Depending on the minimum
required correlation, \texttt{tsah} could be useful, while \texttt{edh}
has the strongest correlation with \texttt{ct} out of all the variables
in the data and should definitely be included in the imputation model.
For the imputation of \texttt{pupil}, none of the potential auxiliary
variables has a very strong relation, but \texttt{hypots} could be used.
We conclude that we can exclude \texttt{hypox} from the data, since this
is neither an analysis model variable nor an auxiliary variable for
imputation:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> dat <- select(dat, !hypox)  # remove variable
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

As previously stated, complete case analysis lowers statistical power
and may bias results. The complete case analysis estimates are:
