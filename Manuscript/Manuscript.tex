\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In many contemporary data analysis efforts, some form of hierarchical or
clustered structure is recorded. For example, students clustered within
schools, or patients clustered within studies in individual patient data
meta-analyses. Analyzing such multilevel data requires specialized
techniques that take the clustered structure into account, since
ignoring it may be harmful to the statistical inferences and can yield
biased results. Imagine a case where cross-level interactions between
unit-level variables and cluster-level variables are present. The
cluster to which a unit belongs may then influence the unit-level
observations--and vice versa for each of the units that make up the
cluster \citep{hox17}. These relations can and should be taken into
account when developing analysis models for multilevel data for the
simple reason that groups of observations share some common variance.

The variability due to clustering is often measured by means of the
intraclass coefficient (ICC). The ICC can be seen as the percentage of
variance that can be attributed to the cluster-level, where a high ICC
would indicate that a lot of variability is due to the cluster
structure. Multilevel models typically accommodate for this variability
by including separate intercepts for each cluster. Such fixed effects
relieve the restriction imposed by single-level models: equal group
means across clusters. Additionally, models may include random effects
of predictors across clusters, and random error terms (heterogeneous
residual error variances; see e.g. \citet{hox17} and \citet{jong21}).
There are many names for models that take clustering into account. Some
popular examples are `multilevel models', `hierarchical models', `mixed
effect models' and `random effect models'.

\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

The process of analyzing multilevel data is further complicated when not
all data entries are observed. Just as with single level data,
missingness may occur at the unit level. But with multiple levels of
data comes the potential for clustered missingness. Missingness in
multilevel data can therefore be categorized into two general patterns:
systematic missingness and sporadic missingness \citep{resc13}. We have
visualized the difference between these types of missingness in Figure
1. The figure shows an \(n \times p\) set
\(\mathbf{X} = X_1, \dots, X_p\), with \(n\) units distributed over
\(N\) clusters, and \(p=3\) columns. Column \texttt{X1} is completely
observed. Column \texttt{X2} is systematically missing and column
\texttt{X3} is sporadically missing. Systematic missingness can be
further subdivided into unobserved constants (i.e., the same value
within clusters) and non-measured random variables (which may differ per
unit within clusters). In Figure 1, the former would imply that the
unobserved values for units 3 and 4 on column \texttt{X2} are identical.
With the latter, the values would differ. The optimal strategy for
dealing with the missingness may therefore depend on the observed
missing data pattern.

Another characteristic of the missing data to take into account in
analyses is the mechanism behind the missingness. Although the essence
of the true non-response mechanism may not be known, it can be inferred
or assumed to be one of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), where the probability to be
  missing is equal across all data entries;
\item
  Missing At Random (MAR), where the probability to be missing depends
  on observed information;
\item
  Missing Not At Random (MNAR), where the probability to be missing
  depends on unrecorded information, making the missingness
  non-ignorable \citep{rubi76, meng94}. Depending on the assumed
  missingness mechanism, missing data handling strategies may be more or
  less suitable, see e.g., \citet{yuce08} and \citet{hox15}.
\end{itemize}

Ignoring the missingness in analyses can be extremely harmful to
inferences. Complete case analysis (i.e., excluding all units with one
or more missing entries) can introduce bias in statistical inference and
lowers statistical power. Instead, the missingness should be
accommodated \emph{before} or \emph{within} the analysis of scientific
interest. Especially the former is very generic and popular and is
widely known as imputation. Imputing (i.e., filling in) the missing
values separates the missing data problem from the scientific problem:
missing data are replaced by plausible values whereafter the completed
data is analysed as if it were completely observed. The \proglang{R}
package \pkg{mice} has become the de-facto standard for imputation by
chained equations, which iteratively solves the missingness on a
variable-by-variable basis. \pkg{mice} is known to yield valid
inferences under many different missing data circumstances
\citep{buur18}. In this paper, we'll discuss how to use \pkg{mice} in
the context of multilevel data, under varying missing data mechanisms.

\hypertarget{aim-of-this-paper}{%
\subsection{Aim of this paper}\label{aim-of-this-paper}}

This papers serves as a tutorial for imputing incomplete multilevel data
with \pkg{mice}. We provide practical guidelines and code snippets for
different missing data situations. For reasons of brevity, we focus on
imputation by chained equations exclusively (although the alternative,
joint modeling imputation for multilevel data or \pkg{jomo}
\citet{jomo}, has been implemented in \pkg{mice} as well). Other useful
resources for the analysis of incomplete multilevel data include the
\proglang{R} packages \pkg{mitml}, \pkg{miceadds}, and \pkg{mdmb}, and
the empirical work by \citet{audi18} and \citet{grun18}. Note that this
tutorial paper assumes a basic level of knowledge on multilevel models.
We're providing an overview of implementations. It's up-to the reader to
decide which multilevel strategy suits their data. We won't go into
detail for the different methods (and equations). This paper is just a
software tutorial, so we'll keep it practical. Assumed knowledge also
includes the use of the `piping operator', \texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%},
adopted from the \texttt{magrittr} package and avidly used among
\texttt{tidy} workflows, and the \texttt{lme4} notation for multilevel
models.

To illustrate how to impute incomplete multilevel data, we structure
this tutorial around three case studies:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{mice::popmis} (simulated data on perceived popularity,
  \(n = 2,000\) pupils across \(N = 100\) schools, with univariate MAR
  missingness);
\item
  \texttt{GJRM::hiv} (simulated data on HIV diagnoses, \(n = 6,416\)
  patients across \(N = 9\) regions, with univariate MNAR missingness)
\item
  \texttt{metamisc::impact} (empirical data on traumatic brain injuries,
  \(n = 11,022\) patients across \(N = 15\) studies, without
  \texttt{NA}s).
\end{itemize}

In each case study we highlight one aspect of the imputation workflow.
With the \texttt{mice::popmis} data, we show different ways of designing
an imputation model and what happens if you misspecify this model. With
the \texttt{GJRM::hiv} data we extend the imputation model to include
Heckman-type selection-inclusion methods. And with the
\texttt{metamisc::impact} data we provide a example of multivariate
missingness in real-world data. For all case studies we discuss the
nature of the incomplete data, the imputation model(s), and evaluation
of the imputed data: A. Choose an analysis model (so the imputation
model will be compatible with the analyses); B. Evaluate the incomplete
data; C. Develop the imputation model(s); D. Impute the missingness; E.
Evaluate the imputations.

\hypertarget{how-not-to-impute-case-study-i-popularity}{%
\section{How (not) to impute (Case Study I:
Popularity)}\label{how-not-to-impute-case-study-i-popularity}}

In this section we'll go over the different steps involved with imputing
incomplete multilevel data. The data we're using is the \texttt{popmis}
dataset from the \texttt{mice} package. This is a simulated dataset with
pupils (\(n = 2000\)) clustered within schools (\(N = 100\)). In this
tutorial we'll use the following variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{school}, school identification number (clustering variable);
\item
  \texttt{popular}, pupil popularity (self-rating between 0 and 10;
  unit-level);
\item
  \texttt{sex}, pupil sex (0=boy, 1=girl; unit-level);
\item
  \texttt{texp}, teacher experience (in years; cluster-level).
\end{itemize}

The analysis model corresponding to this dataset is multilevel
regression with random intercepts, random slopes and a cross-level
interaction. The outcome variable is \texttt{popular}, which is
predicted from the unit-level variable \texttt{sex} and the
cluster-level variable \texttt{texp}. The regression equation\footnote{add
  the `level notation' (Bryk and Raudenbush, 1992) and/or matrix
  notation (`linear mixed effects model'; Laird and Ware, 1982) too?}
and \texttt{lme4} notation for this model are

\[
\text{popular}_{ij} =
\gamma_{00} + 
\gamma_{10} \text{ sex}_{ij} + 
\gamma_{01} \text{ texp}_{j} + 
\gamma_{11} \text{ texp}_{j} \times \text{sex}_{ij} + 
u_{0j} + 
u_{1j} \text{ sex}_{ij} + 
e_{ij} \\
\]

\[
\texttt{popular} \sim  \texttt{1 + sex + texp + sex:texp + (1 + sex | school)}
\]

TODO: add all estimimates, seed, and version nr., this also shows the
workflow for pooling etc.

Since the data is simulated and the missingness is induced, we can
compare our inferences after imputation to the true complete data. The
data is created in such a way that the clustering variable
\texttt{school} explains quite some variance in the outcome variable
\texttt{popular}. We express this using the intraclass correlation, ICC
\(=\) 0.58. We'll evaluate the ICC after each missing data strategy, and
compare the estimated fixed effects:

\hypertarget{incomplete-data}{%

Load the data into the environment and select the relevant variables:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> popmis <- mice::popmis[, c("school", "popular", "sex", "texp")] 
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{Manuscript_files/figure-latex/pop_pat-1} 

}

\caption[Missing data pattern in the popularity data]{Missing data pattern in the popularity data}\label{fig:pop_pat}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

The missingness is univariate and sporadic, which is illustrated in the
missing data pattern in Figure \ref{fig:pop_pat}. The ICC in the
incomplete data is 0.56.

To develop the best imputation model for the incomplete variable
\texttt{popular}, we need to know whether the missingness depends on the
observed values of other variables. We'll highlight only one other
variable to illustrate, but ideally one would inspect all relations. The
questions we'll ask are: `Does the missing data of pupil popularity
(\texttt{popular}) depend on observed teacher popularity
(\texttt{texp})?'. This can be evaluated statistically, but visual
inspection usually suffices. We'll make a histogram of \texttt{texp}
separately for the pupils with known popularity and missing popularity.

In Figure \ref{fig:pop_dist} we see that \textbf{{[}update this part{]}}
the distribution for the missing \texttt{popular} is further to the
right than the distribution for observed \texttt{popular}. This would
indicate a right-tailed MAR missingness. (In fact, this is exactly what
happens, because the missingness in these data was created manually.)
We've made it observable by examining the relations between the
missingness in popular and the observed data in \texttt{texp}.

\hypertarget{complete-case-analysis-not-recommended}{%
\subsubsection{Complete case analysis (not
recommended)}\label{complete-case-analysis-not-recommended}}

Complete case analysis ignores the observations with missingness
altogether, which may even introduce bias in MCAR situations.

\hypertarget{imputation-ignoring-the-cluster-variable-not-recommended}{%
\subsubsection{Imputation ignoring the cluster variable (not
recommended)}\label{imputation-ignoring-the-cluster-variable-not-recommended}}

The first imputation model that we'll use is likely to be invalid. In
this model, we ignore the multilevel structure of the data, despite the
high ICCs. This is purely to illustrate the effects of ignoring the
clustering in our imputation effort.

We'll use predictive mean matching to impute the continuous variables
and logistic regression to impute the binary variable \texttt{sex}. We
do not use the observation identifier \texttt{pupil} or cluster
identifier \texttt{school} as predictors to impute other variables.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> # dry run to get imputation parameters
R> ini <- mice(popmis, maxit = 0)
R> 
R> # extract predictor matrix and adjust
R> pred <- ini$pred
R> pred[, c("school")] <- 0
R> 
R> # impute the data, ignoring the cluster structure
R> imp_ignored <- mice(popmis, maxit = 1, pred = pred, print = FALSE)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeChunk}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Manuscript_files/figure-latex/pop_ignored_eval-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

As the original ICCs show, 100\% of the variance in \texttt{texp} can be
attributed to the clustering variable \texttt{school}. This tells us
that the multilevel structure of the data should be taken into account.
If we don't, we'll end up with incorrect imputations, biasing the effect
of the clusters towards zero.

We can also observe that the teacher experience increases slightly after
imputation. This is due to the MNAR missingness in \texttt{texp}. Higher
values for \texttt{texp} have a larger probability to be missing. This
may not a problem, however, if at least one pupil in each school has
teacher experience recorded, we can deductively impute the correct
(i.e.~true) value for every pupil in the school.

Add: Assumes exchangability between units.

\hypertarget{imputation-with-the-cluster-variable-as-predictor-not-recommended}{%
\subsubsection{Imputation with the cluster variable as predictor (not
recommended)}\label{imputation-with-the-cluster-variable-as-predictor-not-recommended}}

We'll now use \texttt{school} as a predictor to impute all other
variables. This is still not recommended practice, since it only works
under certain circumstances and results may be biased
\citep{drec15, ende16}. But at least, it includes some multilevel
aspect. This method is also called `fixed cluster imputation', and uses
N-1 indicator variables representing allocation of N clusters as a fixed
factor in the model \citep{reit06, ende16}. Colloquially, this is
`multilevel imputation for dummies'.

Add: doesn't work with syst missing (only sporadically). There's some
pro's and con's. May not differ much if the number of clusters is low.

The more the random effects are of interest, the more you need ml
models.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> # adjust the predictor matrix
R> pred <- ini$pred 
R> # pred[, "pupil"] <- 0
R> 
R> # impute the data, cluster as predictor
R> imp_predictor <- mice(popmis, maxit = 1, pred = pred, print = FALSE)
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

\begin{CodeChunk}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Manuscript_files/figure-latex/pop_predictor_eval-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

Now, we can clearly see that the imputed values of \texttt{texp} are
higher than the observed values, which is in line with right-tailed MAR.

The ICCs are way more in line with the ICCs in the incomplete data. But
this is a quick and dirty way of imputing multilevel data. We
\emph{should} be using a multilevel model.

\hypertarget{imputation-with-random-effects}{%
\subsubsection{Imputation with random
effects}\label{imputation-with-random-effects}}

With \texttt{2l.norm} we impute the outcome with a multilevel model
assuming random slopes for each variable in the imputation model and
homogeneous within-cluster variance.

``Van Buuren (2011) considered the homoscedastic linear mixed model as
invalid for imputing incomplete predictors, and investigated only the
2l.norm method, which allows for heterogeneous error variances''
\citep{buur18}.

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
R> pred <- ini$pred
R> pred["popular", ] <- c(-2, 2, 2, 2) 
R> #-2 for the cluster variable, 2 for random effects

cluster-specific residual error variance.

\section{How to handle non-random selection (Case study II:
HIV)}\label{how-to-handle-non-random-selection-case-study-ii-hiv}}

Data are simulated and included in the \texttt{GJRM} package. We will
use the following variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{region} Cluster variable,
\item
  \texttt{hiv} HIV diagnosis (0=no, 1=yes),
\item
  \texttt{age} Age of the patient,
\item
  \texttt{marital} Marital status,
\item
  \texttt{condom} Condom use during last intercourse,
\item
  \texttt{smoke} Smoker (levels; inclusion restriction variable).
\end{itemize}

The imputation of these date is based on the toy example from
\href{https://github.com/johamunoz/Heckman-IPDMA/blob/main/Toy_example.R}{IPDMA
Heckman Github repo}.

\begin{CodeChunk}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{Manuscript_files/figure-latex/hiv-1} \end{center}

\end{CodeChunk}

From the missing data pattern we see that we can set \texttt{maxit} to
1, since there is only one variable with missingness.

The inclusion restriction variable should be a predictor of the the
actual value of the variable of interest, but \emph{not} of missingness
indicator for the variable of interest. In this case, the data were
simulated to adhere to this requirement. Namely, \(\beta_{smoke}\) =
-0.064, 95\% CI {[}-0.256, 0.126{]} for the analysis model
(\texttt{formula\ =\ hiv\ \textasciitilde{}\ .}), and \(\beta_{smoke}\)
= -0.265, 95\% CI {[}-0.422, -0.11{]} for the selection model
(\texttt{formula\ =\ is.na(hiv)\ \textasciitilde{}\ .}). This means the
assumptions for the Heckman-type selection model are met.

The data is already imputed (Steyerberg et al, 2008), so we'll induce
missingness ourselves. For example, MAR missingness varying by
cluster.\footnote{Observed data pattern should differ per cluster. So,
  in cluster 1, the missingness would depend on age, but not in cluster
  two. Split the dataframe and run \texttt{ampute()} on each cluster.}
